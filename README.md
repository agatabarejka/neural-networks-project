## TASK
The task was to predict child gender (male/female) based on mother speech. <br>

## DATA
Data comes from TalkBank project and was shared by Michael Brent and Jeffrey M. Siskind <br><br>
*data*: https://sla.talkbank.org/TBB/childes/Eng-NA/Brent <br>
*more info*: https://childes.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Brent.html <br><br>
It is a transcription of child-directed speech for 16 dyads (mother-child pairs).<br>

## TO DO
Does child-directed speech differ enough to predict the gender?<br><br>
Supposedly yes, but this answer is obvious as there is a bunch of directly gender-related words like: boy, girl, personal names or pronouns.
A further goal of this model is to use it in gender-stereotypes research in order to check if gender stereotypes/roles are shaped as early as when the caregivers talk to infants.<br><br>
To do so, all "obvious" words indicating gender should be removed. Only then we'll be able to check if child-directed speech is "gender-biased".
